Tilda is a discord bot written in typescript made for basic server management, role commands, fun games, and more!

## Features

### Commands
* Tilda has been updated to make full use of Discord's slash commands!
* Tilda has a coin (imaginary currency) based economy that is used to track scores and allow users to play multiple games!
* Tilda can manage roles in a server, allowing users to gain a custom role with whatever name and color they desire
* The ability to play music in voice channels allowing users to have a listening session with their friends (audio is retreived from youtube)

### Fun
* Tilda will randomize the name and color of the main server Tilda was made for
* Tilda will generate random events for users to gain more coins
* Explore Tilda's other commands using the /help command!

### WIP (may be added down the line)
* randomizing name and color of multiple servers as option
* rework and reimplement fishing minigame
